# **Intro**

Small and compact led cube that is (kinda) easy to build.I decided to make this project for my own amusement and to train smd soldering and pcb design. Code is not writen by me all credit goes to http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-CUBE-CODE-4x4x4-Arduino/ .

# **Making boards**
in [GBRLS](https://github.com/Ropecar5/Led-Cube/tree/master/GRBLS) folder there are all grbl files needed to make boards for led cube.
you will need to make 2 boards ,one top one on wich you will place your led cube and one bottom one that has all electronics.
There are also Eagle schematic and board files for both pcbs . I ordered them [JLC pcb](https://jlcpcb.com/) and they came fine.

# **Code**
Once again code is not written by me. firstly you will need to download. 

ledfade and shooting star are code examples.I didnt write the code for these and i didnt make the aplication that generates the code 
To generate the code i used this instructable http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-CUBE-CODE-4x4x4-Arduino/ .
