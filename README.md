# **Intro**

Small and compact led cube that is (kinda) easy to build.I decided to make this project for my own amusement and to train smd soldering and pcb design. Code and program are not made  by me all credit goes to: http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-CUBE-CODE-4x4x4-Arduino/ .

# **Making boards**
in [GBRLS](https://github.com/Ropecar5/Led-Cube/tree/master/GRBLS) folder there are all grbl files needed to make boards for led cube.
you will need to make 2 boards ,one top one on wich you will place your led cube and one bottom one that has all electronics.
There are also Eagle schematic and board files for both pcbs . I ordered them [JLC pcb](https://jlcpcb.com/) and they came fine.

# **Code**
Once again code is not written by me. There are 2 example programs [LEDFADE](https://github.com/Ropecar5/Led-Cube/tree/master/LEDFADE) and
[shooting star](https://github.com/Ropecar5/Led-Cube/tree/master/shooting_star).
