Files for 4x4x4 led cube

in grbls folder there are all grbl files needed to make boards for led cube.
you will need to make 2 boards ,one top one on wich you will place your led cube and one bottom one that has all electronics.
There are also Eagle schematic and board files for both pcbs .

ledfade and shooting star are code examples.I didnt write the code for these and i didnt make the aplication that generates the code 
To generate the code i used this instructable http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-CUBE-CODE-4x4x4-Arduino/ .
